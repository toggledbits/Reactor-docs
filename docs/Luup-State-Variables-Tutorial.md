# Luup/UPnP State Variables Tutorial

State variables in Luup are (loosely) based on [UPnP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Plug_and_Play). They are used to persistently store some information about the device, such as whether a light is currently on or off, or a thermostat's setpoints or operating modes, etc.

State variables live in *service*. A service is a collection of states and actions that a device might have. For example, any device that can be turned on or off might implement the `urn:upnp-org:serviceId:SwitchPower1` service, which includes the state variables for tracking the device's commanded state (`Target`) and its current actual state (`Status`), as well as the action to change the state (`SetTarget`). The device could be a light switch, or it could be an A/V receiver, space heater, or the latest Z-Wave bar blender.

Services are layered. If the device happened to be an in-wall light dimmer, it would implement, *in addition to SwitchPower1*, the `urn:upnp-org:serviceId:Dimming1` service, which provides the states and actions necessary to allow control over the brightness level. So the fact that the device implements both `SwitchPower1` and `Dimming1` services means that you can turn it on and off like any type of switch, but also that you can control the brightness. Other services could also be added for other features and capabilities the device has.

For Z-Wave devices, a major part of Luup's work is making sure that the state variables always reflect the actual state of the device. When the device sends Luup a message that its state has changed (e.g. a switch says it has been turned on or off), Luup updates its state variables to match. The same would be true of Bluetooth and ZigBee. Plugins may or may not be associated with a physical device: the Hue plugin, for example, is associated with a Hue hub and its connected devices, but the Day/Night plugin is not associated with any devices, it just looks at time and sets state variables according to its logic.

You refer to state variables to identify the state of a device. In order to test device state, you need to know which state variable is going to give you the information you need, and this is one of the big learning curves in doing automation on Vera using Reactor, Lua, or any other plugin. The [Vera Community Forums](https://community.getvera.com/) are a great place to get this information. There is also an old-but-still-relevant [page on Vera's wiki](http://wiki.micasaverde.com/index.php/Luup_UPnP_Variables_and_Actions) that describes the "core" services Luup uses and the state variables and actions of these services.

## Service IDs are Important
A common mistake when trying to access a state variable is to use the wrong service Id, or assume that the service Id doesn't matter. State variable names *are not unique by themselves,* and so the variable name alone does not sufficiently identify the variable or state. To properly identify a state variable, you must know *both its name and the service ID* to which it belongs--it is the *combination* of service ID and variable name that is unique. 

Therefore, if you want to test that a switch is on, you must not only know that the variable name is `Status`, but also that the service ID is `urn:upnp-org:serviceId:SwitchPower1`. If you use a different service ID or omit it, you will not get the on/off state of the device--you'll get nothing, or some other status that isn't necessarily on/off. Reactor simplifies this somewhat on its list of state variables in *Device State* conditions by hiding the service names when a variable name is unique on that device. If the variable name is not unique on the device, however, Reactor will show the abbreviated service Id with the variable name, so you can differentiate them. Basically, Reactor tries to make it as simple for you as possible.

## Determining the Service ID of a Variable
In the Vera UI (UI7), you can easily see the service ID that a variable belongs to by hovering over the variable name in the device's "Advanced" tab (in its control panel) under the "Variables" sub-tab.
