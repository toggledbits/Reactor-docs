# Change House Mode Action

The *Change House Mode* action won't surprise anybody with its behavior: it changes the house mode to the selected mode.

All of the usual Vera/Luup semantics applicable to changing the house mode (delays, etc) will apply. This action does nothing special, it just acts as a shortcut to a device action against the controller itself.
